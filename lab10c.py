            First step towards installing the Streamlit framework was by creating an empty folder. Once that is done, open your code editor(preferably VScode). Then open a terminal, cd into the empty folder that you created
            . Then type the command "pip install streamlit" to install the framwork to your device. The next step is to create an empty .py file (in my case lab10c.py), in the same folder, to write the code for the website. Once you have written some 
            code in the .py file, open the terminal again(cd to the same directory) and type the command "streamlit run lab10c.py", NOTE: Change the name of the .py file from lab10c.py to whatever you named your file. Once that is done,
            it will automatically open a localhost for you with your webpage.

            with this new framework seemed a bit confusing at the start but with more and more practice and trying new things I got my hands around this and started understanding it really well. Then, importing the framework and its libraries
            ,for changing the theme on click/getting some animation on the webpage, took a bit of time but again, researching upon this eventully made it work at the end.
